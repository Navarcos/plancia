          RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
          This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
          For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
          the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
          Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
          this init container will be continually restarted on
          exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
          containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
          will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and

          container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait

          container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
          init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
          completed.

          Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
          The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
          owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
          pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
          `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
          entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
          is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

          An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
          will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
          volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
          the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
          meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
          owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
          this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
          manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

          pathType determines the interpretation of the path matching. PathType can
          be one of the following values:
          * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly.
          * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is
            done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the
            list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a
            match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the
            request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring
            of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar
            matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).
          * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to
            the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType
            or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.
          Implementations are required to support all path types.

          to load or validate the Assigned config, etc.
          Errors may occur at different points while syncing config. Earlier errors (e.g. download or
          checkpointing errors) will not result in a rollback to LastKnownGood, and may resolve across
          Kubelet retries. Later errors (e.g. loading or validating a checkpointed config) will result in
          a rollback to LastKnownGood. In the latter case, it is usually possible to resolve the error
          by fixing the config assigned in Spec.ConfigSource.
          You can find additional information for debugging by searching the error message in the Kubelet log.
          Error is a human-readable description of the error state; machines can check whether or not Error

          The Assigned config becomes the LastKnownGood config when the node determines
          that the Assigned config is stable and correct.
          This is currently implemented as a 10-minute soak period starting when the local
          record of Assigned config is updated. If the Assigned config is Active at the end
          of this period, it becomes the LastKnownGood. Note that if Spec.ConfigSource is
          reset to nil (use local defaults), the LastKnownGood is also immediately reset to nil,
          because the local default config is always assumed good.
          You should not make assumptions about the node's method of determining config stability
          and correctness, as this may change or become configurable in the future.

      deletionTimestamp:
        description: |-
          DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
          field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
          directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
          from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
          finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
          Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
          future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
          For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
          by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
          the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
          remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
          exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
          resource is fully terminated.
          If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

          Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested.
          Read-only.

          from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries
          in this list can only be removed.
          Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
          because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
          finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
          If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
          in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
          waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
          component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
          Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
          are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

          If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source,
          it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source.
          When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef,
          and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified.

          volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
          core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
          When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
          the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
          provisioner.
          This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
          if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
          compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
          both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
          value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
          When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
          dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
            specified.
          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
            in any namespaces.
          (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
          (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

          it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClass
          will be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set.
          If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClass
          will be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists.

          The phase of a Pod is a simple, high-level summary of where the Pod is in its lifecycle.
          The conditions array, the reason and message fields, and the individual container status
          arrays contain more detail about the pod's status.
          There are five possible phase values:

          Pending: The pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes system, but one or more of the
          container images has not been created. This includes time before being scheduled as
          well as time spent downloading images over the network, which could take a while.
          Running: The pod has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have been created.
          At least one container is still running, or is in the process of starting or restarting.
          Succeeded: All containers in the pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted.
          Failed: All containers in the pod have terminated, and at least one container has
          terminated in failure. The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated
          by the system.
          Unknown: For some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained, typically due to an
          error in communicating with the host of the pod.

          of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
          traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
          the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
          be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of

        description: |-
          MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
          When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
          between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
          The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
          or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
          labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
          In this case, the global minimum is 1.
          +-------+-------+-------+
          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
          +-------+-------+-------+
          |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
          +-------+-------+-------+
          - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
          scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
          violate MaxSkew(1).
          - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
          When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
          to topologies that satisfy it.
          It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
        type: integer
      minDomains:
        description: |-
          MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
          When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
          Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
          And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
          this value has no effect on scheduling.
          As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
          scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
          If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
          Valid values are integers greater than 0.
          When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
          labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
          +-------+-------+-------+
          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
          +-------+-------+-------+
          |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
          +-------+-------+-------+
          The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
          In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
          because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
          it will violate MaxSkew.

          of pods into each bucket.
          We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
          Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
          nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
          e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.

          WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy

          - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
          - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
            but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
            skew.
          A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
          if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
          "MaxSkew" on some topology.
          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
          labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
          +-------+-------+-------+

          +-------+-------+-------+
          | P P P |   P   |   P   |
          +-------+-------+-------+
          If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
          to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
          MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
          won't make it *more* imbalanced.

          d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
             a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
             information on the connection between this volume type
             and PersistentVolumeClaim).

          Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific

          Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
          be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
          more information.
